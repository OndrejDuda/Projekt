OSPF
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for IP. It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. 
A link-state protocol makes routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. 
The state of a link is a description of that interface and the relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface 
information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the routers connected 
to that network, and so forth. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs).
OSPF version 3, which is described in RFC 2740, supports IPv6.

Before you enable OSPF for IPv6 on an interface, you must perform the following:
Complete the OSPF network strategy and planning for your IPv6 network. For example, you must decide whether multiple areas are required.
Enable IPv6 unicast routing.
Enable IPv6 on the interface.
Configure the IP Security (IPsec) secure socket application program interface (API) on OSPF for IPv6 in order to enable 
authentication and encryption.

Advantages of MultiArea OSPF .

To divide your large OSPF network into area has the following advantages:

•  Reduced frequency of SPF calculations: Detailed route information exists within each area, link-state changes not flooded to other 
   areas

•  Smaller routing tables: Instead of advertising these explicit routes outside the area, routers can be configured to summarize the 
   routes into one or more summary addresses.

Reduced LSU overhead: Rather than send an LSU about each network within an area, a router can advertise a single summarized route or 
small number of routes between areas.

Backbone area :

Area whose primary function is the fast and efficient movement of IP packets.

•  Interconnect with other OSPF area types
•  Known as OSPF area 0 which all other areas must directly connect to.

Regular area (Non-backbone) :

•  Connects users and resources.

•  A regular area does not allow traffic from another area to use its links to reach other areas. All traffic from other areas 
   must cross through area 0.
