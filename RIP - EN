Routing Information Protocol(RIP)

History
The Routing Information Protocol, or RIP, as it is more commonly called, is one of the most enduring of all routing protocols. 
RIP is also one of the more easily confused protocols because a variety of RIP-like routing protocols proliferated, some of 
which even used the same name! RIP and the myriad RIP-like protocols were based on the same set of algorithms that use distance 
vectors to mathematically compare routes to identify the best path to any given destination address. These algorithms emerged 
from academic research that dates back to 1957.

Routing Updates

RIP sends routing-update messages at regular intervals and when the network topology changes. When a router receives a 
routing update that includes changes to an entry, it updates its routing table to reflect the new route. The metric value 
for the path is increased by 1, and the sender is indicated as the next hop. RIP routers maintain only the best route 
(the route with the lowest metric value) to a destination. After updating its routing table, the router immediately begins 
transmitting routing updates to inform other network routers of the change. These updates are sent independently of the 
regularly scheduled updates that RIP routers send.

RIP - Stability Features

RIP prevents routing loops from continuing indefinitely by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path 
from the source to a destination. The maximum number of hops in a path is 15. If a router receives a routing update that 
contains a new or changed entry, and if increasing the metric value by 1 causes the metric to be infinity (that is, 16), 
he network destination is considered unreachable. The downside of this stability feature is that it limits the maximum diameter 
of a RIP network to less than 16 hops.
RIP includes a number of other stability features that are common to many routing protocols. These features are designed to 
provide stability despite potentially rapid changes in a network's topology. For example, RIP implements the split horizon 
and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.

Description
RIP is a type of distance-vector routing protocol (vektor distance) using Bellman-Ford algoritm for specifying best way in 
network. Metric of routing is count of jumps to final destination (hop count). As protection against routing loops is 
implements limited number of routing hops to destination, maximal number of hops is 15. This limit also limits size of networks 
where we can use RIP (16 hps is consider as infinity distance, it is using to indication inaccessible and it is unreachable). 
Originally each router with RIP sending update of routing table in interval of 30 seconds. It was ok from the beginning because 
routing table was not that large as now. Networks was not affected so much. Due to growth network (routing tables as well) 
this solution proved unsuitable, because network was every 30 second inundated by the sheer amount of data. Modern 
implementation of RIP solved using different methods tuning intervals every router separaely that data has been spread in time, 
and avoid intermittently to large data flows.
Today RIP is not a good choice, because time it needs to converge or extensibility lag behind other protocols as EIGRP, OSPF or 
IS-IS. Moreover (without RIP-MTI algoritm) is due to limited count of hops very limited size of network in which you can 
deploy RIP. On the other hand the RIP is easier to configure than other protocols.

Other characteristics of RIP include
• RIP supports IP and IPX routing.
• RIP utilizes UDP port 520
• RIP routes have an administrative distance of 120.
• RIP has a maximum hopcount of 15 hops.

Shortly
RIP adheres to the following Distance Vector characteristics:
• RIP sends out periodic routing updates (every 30 seconds)
• RIP sends out the full routing table every periodic update
• RIP uses a form of distance as its metric (in this case, hopcount)
• RIP uses the Bellman-Ford Distance Vector algorithm to determine
the best “path” to a particular destination 

RIP Versions
RIP has two versions, Version 1 (RIPv1) and Version 2 (RIPv2).
RIPv1 (RFC 1058) is classful, and thus does not include the subnet mask
with its routing table updates. Because of this, RIPv1 does not support
Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs). When using RIPv1, networks
must be contiguous, and subnets of a major network must be configured with
identical subnet masks. Otherwise, route table inconsistencies (or worse)
will occur.
RIPv1 sends updates as broadcasts to address 255.255.255.255.
RIPv2 (RFC 2543) is classless, and thus does include the subnet mask with
its routing table updates. RIPv2 fully supports VLSMs, allowing
discontiguous networks and varying subnet masks to exist.
Other enhancements offered by RIPv2 include:
• Routing updates are sent via multicast, using address 224.0.0.9
• Encrypted authentication can be configured between RIPv2 routers
• Route tagging is supported (explained in a later section)
RIPv2 can interoperate with RIPv1. By default:
• RIPv1 routers will sent only Version 1 packets
• RIPv1 routers will receive both Version 1 and 2 updates
• RIPv2 routers will both send and receive only Version 2 updates 

So why use RIP?
• RIP is easy to implement →
– Many different implementations.
– The protocol has been rigorously tested by many
teams of developers.
• In a small network, RIP has very little overhead in
terms of bandwidth, memory consumption,
processor load, etc.
